# Introduction

If you are reading this, it probably means you want to learn how to create your own integration for the app MultiViewer for F1. Guess what! You aren't at the perfect place!

Just kidding, here you will learn about the API.

## Before you begin

Alright, making an integration is cool and all, but there are some prerequisites to it. To create an integration, you can use any language, but just keep a few "rules" in mind,

* Make your integration easy for everyone to use.
* Create a "beautiful" UI in English !
* Make it Open-Source on GitHub !
* You will be BANNED :hammer: if your app is white mode only.

If you're going to use JavaScript for your integration, I recommend you to use the [NPM_F1MV_API](https://github/LapsTimeOFF/npm_f1mv_api) module. It will help you to call easily the F1MV API.
